<h1><b>Stock Price Predictor - Capstone Project</b></h1>
<br>
The following is an exploration into using Machine Learning techniques to predict future stock prices. The final presentation is in the form of a report and web application.
<h3><b>Requirements</b></h3>
<br>
This is currently a python 2.7 project. In the root of the repository there is a "requirements.txt" file that can be used to install all dependecies.<p>
The major dependecies are:
 </p>
<ol type=1>
<li>jupyter==1.0.0
<li>Flask==0.12.2
<li>matplotlib==2.0.2
<li>numpy==1.13.1
<li>pandas==0.20.1
<li>pandas-datareader==0.5.0
<li>scikit-learn==0.18.1
 </ol>
<h3><b>Web Application</b></h3>

There are two ways to exlore the web application.
<br>
<ol type=1>
 
<li>You can download the repositry and run the application yourself. The web app is in the repository folder named "www"
https://github.com/subhadeep-123/Machine-Learning-Capstone/tree/master/www to run the application ensure you have all required dependecies installed (found in the requirements.txt file), cd into the "www" folder and run "python routes.py" from the command line

<li>Alternatively you can view the live version currently hosted on Heroku https://glacial-brushlands-28574.herokuapp.com/
