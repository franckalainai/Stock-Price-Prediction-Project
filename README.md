Machine-Learning-Capstone - Stock Price Predictor
The following is an exploration into using Machine Learning techniques to predict future stock prices. The final presentation is in the form of a report and web application.

Requirements
This is currently a python 2.7 project. In the root of the repository there is a "requirements.txt" file that can be used to install all dependecies.

The major dependecies are:

jupyter==1.0.0
Flask==0.12.2
matplotlib==2.0.2
numpy==1.13.1
pandas==0.20.1

scikit-learn==0.18.1
Report
A full write up and analysis can be found in the projects report which is located in the "report" folder of the repository. https://github.com/mbozelka/Machine-Learning-Capstone/tree/master/report

Initial Analysis
There is a detailed initial analysis for the project in the form of a Jupyter Notebook which can be found in the "data-exploration" folder of the repository. https://github.com/mbozelka/Machine-Learning-Capstone/tree/master/data-exploration

Web Application
There are two ways to exlore the web application.

You can download the repositry and run the application yourself. The web app is in the repository folder named "www"
https://github.com/mbozelka/Machine-Learning-Capstone/tree/master/www

to run the application ensure you have all required dependecies installed (found in the requirements.txt file), cd into the "www" folder and run "python routes.py" from the command line

Alternatively you can view the live version currently hosted on Heroku https://glacial-brushlands-28574.herokuapp.com/
