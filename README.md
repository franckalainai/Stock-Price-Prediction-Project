<h1><b>Machine-Learning-Capstone - Stock Price Predictor</b></h1>
<br>
The following is an exploration into using Machine Learning techniques to predict future stock prices. The final presentation is in the form of a report and web application.
<h3><b>Requirements</b></h3>
<br>
This is currently a python 2.7 project. In the root of the repository there is a "requirements.txt" file that can be used to install all dependecies.
The major dependecies are:
<ol type=1>
<li>jupyter==1.0.0
<li>Flask==0.12.2
<li>matplotlib==2.0.2
<li>numpy==1.13.1
<li>pandas==0.20.1
<li>pandas-datareader==0.5.0
<li>scikit-learn==0.18.1
 </ol>
<h3><b>Report<b></h3>
<br>
A full write up and analysis can be found in the projects report which is located in the "report" folder of the repository. https://github.com/mbozelka/Machine-Learning-Capstone/tree/master/report
<h3><b>Initial Analysis</b></h3>
<br>
There is a detailed initial analysis for the project in the form of a Jupyter Notebook which can be found in the "data-exploration" folder of the repository. https://github.com/mbozelka/Machine-Learning-Capstone/tree/master/data-exploration
<h3><b>Web Application</b></h3>
There are two ways to exlore the web application.
<br>
<ol type=1>
<li>You can download the repositry and run the application yourself. The web app is in the repository folder named "www"
https://github.com/mbozelka/Machine-Learning-Capstone/tree/master/www

to run the application ensure you have all required dependecies installed (found in the requirements.txt file), cd into the "www" folder and run "python routes.py" from the command line

<li>Alternatively you can view the live version currently hosted on Heroku https://glacial-brushlands-28574.herokuapp.com/
